# WebScraping101
Web Scraping Lab

This repository contains two practice examples for a web scraping workshop that I gave at AllWomen on 20th May 2020. 

The worked examples look at: 
* how to scrape text 
* how to iteratively scrape several pages 
* how to scrape product pages 
* how to store the scraped info in dataframes using pandas

The code for scraping the newspapers was adapted from a news classifier app and the code for scraping La Central was created from scratch.

Both examples use the Beautiful Soup library in Python.
